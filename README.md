# Hand Tracking

This demo uses MediaPipe to track a single hand along with pose landmarks. By default the application tracks the right hand. Use the `--hand` flag to select which hand to follow and `--mirror` if your camera feed is mirrored. The side panel now includes a "MIRROR" button so you can toggle this setting at runtime.
